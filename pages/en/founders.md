### Quality Founders
{% include founders.html %}

### How do I become a Quality Founder?
Everyone who purchases the work of art The Law of Quality at the current price can become a Quality Founder. Each Quality Founder must sign the reverse side of the work of art, thus immortalizing himself or herself on it. This list of signatures, named “Quality Founder”, is visible at all times, since the custom-made special frame also allows for a peek at the back.


### Why is it interesting to become a quality founder?
For the first time, it is possible to increase the quality of a work of art. As a Quality Founder, your name will be inscribed both on the work of art itself and on this web site.

Every Quality Founder can earn money. You will fully retrieve your investment if a new Quality Founder purchases the work of art. Additionally, you receive a 50% share of profits if the price increases. 

### Transactions
1. A Transaction begins with the registration-form. In this formular, you express your interest in purchasing the work of art and becoming a quality founder.
2. You receive a confirmation of the price by the Law of Quality headquarters. In case there is a waiting list, you will also be informed about the waiting period. 
3. It is mandatory that the contract be signed. This can be done online via the confirmation. 
4. After confirmation of contract, you will receive the account details. Please make the deposit.
5. Upon receipt of money, the work of art will be reclaimed from the previous quality founder and send to you.
6. It is not until you have received the work of art that your deposited money will be distributed according to the key for the apportionment of profits. Until then, it remains safely freezed on The Law of Quality’s account.

### Key for apportionment of profits
The price increase between one purchase and the next will always be split according to the same key:
50% go to the previous quality founder
30% go to the participating interpreters
15% go to Patrick Frank
5% go to the art dealer

### Example:

Quality founder1 pays $1’000
Quality founder2 pays $1’500

- → Quality founder1 gets $1’000 back.
- → Quality founder1 receives additional 50% of the increased price, i.e. $250
- → The participating interpreters receive 30% of the increased price, i.e. $150.
- → Patrick Frank receives 15% of the increased price, i.e. $75.
- → The art dealer receives 5% of the increased price, i.e. $25.
